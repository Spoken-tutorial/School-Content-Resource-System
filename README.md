It contains content in the form of various resource types, such as videos, concept maps, images, PhETs (Physics Education Technologies in collaboration with University of Colarado, Boulder) and links to various web pages. It consist of three interfaces i.e. User, Contributor (or teacher) and Admin, for better management and use. Website contains filter search as well as keyword search, so that minimum time is required to access a resource.
